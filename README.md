# SE4050 – Deep Learning Lab 2

## Objectives
- Understand backpropagation and feed-forward neural networks.
- Explore hidden layer tuning and effect on accuracy.
- Train MLP on MNIST dataset with hyperparameter tuning and regularization.

## Files
- `Backprop.ipynb` → Task 1 (increased epochs, improved accuracy).
- `NN_sample.ipynb` → Task 2 (hidden layer tuning).
- `Answer.txt` → Explanation of accuracy vs hidden nodes.
- `MLP_with_MNIST_dataset.ipynb` → Task 3 (MNIST model with hyperparameter tuning, L1/L2 regularization, confusion matrix).

## How to Run
- Upload notebooks to Google Colab or Jupyter.
- Run all cells to reproduce results.
